My C++ SDL remake of Commander Keen 5.

<h2>Compilation</h2>

<h3>Dependencies</h3>

<ol>
<li>MinGW</li>
<li>SDL with SDL_image and SDL_ttf</li>
<li>Make for Windows</li>
</ol>

<h3>To compile</h3>

<ol>
<li>Copy all DLL files in the DLL directory either to System32 (SysWOW64 if you're using x64 Windows) or to the directory you're compiling the program in.</li>
<li>Run `make` in the src directory.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Program Motivation</h2>

I started writing this program because I wanted more experience using C++, OOP,
and graphics libraries. I chose to create a remake of Commander Keen 5
because it's one of my favorite games and I've been playing it since I was
very young.
