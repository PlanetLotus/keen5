My C++ SDL remake of Commander Keen 5.

Compilation
-----------

Dependencies:
1) MinGW
2) SDL with SDL_image and SDL_ttf
3) Make for Windows

To compile:
1) Copy all DLL files in the DLL directory either to System32 (SysWOW64 if
    you're using x64 Windows) or to the directory you're compiling the program
    in.
2) Run `make` in the src directory.

Program Motivation
------------------

I started writing this program because I wanted more experience using C++, OOP,
and graphics libraries. I chose to create a remake of Commander Keen 5
because it's one of my favorite games and I've been playing it since I was
very young.
