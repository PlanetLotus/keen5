=====

My C++ SDL remake of Commander Keen 5.

Compilation
-----------

This program has been compiled under MinGW using Make for Windows.

Program Motivation
------------------

I started writing this program because I wanted more experience using C++, OOP,
and graphics libraries. I chose to create a remake of Commander Keen 5
because it's one of my favorite games and I've been playing it since I was
very young.
